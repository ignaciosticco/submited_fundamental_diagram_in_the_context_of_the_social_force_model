Comentario 11 (referee 2):
The fact that there is more friction force near the walls than in the center is the reason why the pedestrians closer to the wall have the lowest velocity, while the pedestrians in the middle reach higher velocities. 

Comentario 3 (referee 3):

If the desired velocity is much greater
than 1 m/s, the flow vs density relation is a monotonic increasing function.
If the desired velocity is less than 1 m/s, the results are very similar to 1 m/s.
I this paper we will show the results corresponding to 1 m/s because is roughly the average velocity of a moving pedestrian under normal conditions.

Comentario 4 (referee 3):

In other words, the bimodal distribution occurs because when the giant component is formed there are some small clusters ``caged" inside the giant component. These small clusters do not touch any pedestrian of the giant component.
