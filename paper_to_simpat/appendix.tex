\section{\label{appendix_1}The reduced equation of motion}

The equation of motion within the context of the Social 
Force Model includes at least six parameters ($m$, $\tau$, $A$, $B$, 
$\kappa$ and $v_d$), but the equation itself barely depends on two. The process 
of parameter's reduction is achieved by defining the (reduced) magnitudes 

\begin{equation}
 \left\{\begin{array}{lll}
         t' & = & t/\tau \\
         r' & =& r/B \\
         v' & = & v/v_d \\
        \end{array}\right.
\end{equation}

The (reduced) equation of motion reads 


\begin{equation}
\displaystyle\frac{d\mathbf{v}'}{dt'}=
\displaystyle\frac{\tau}{m\,v_d}\bigg(\mathbf{f}_d+
\mathbf{f}_s+\mathbf{f}_g\bigg)\label{eqn_appendix_1}
\end{equation}

It is straight forward from Eq.~(\ref{eqn_appendix_1}) that the 
corresponding reduced forces can 
be defined as follows\\

\begin{equation}
 \left\{\begin{array}{lll}
         \mathbf{f}_d' & = & \hat{\mathbf{e}}_d-\mathbf{v}' \\
         && \\
         \mathbf{f}_s' & =& \mathcal{A}\,\exp(r'-d')\,\hat{\mathbf{n}} \\
         && \\
         \mathbf{f}_g' & = & 
\mathcal{K}\,(2r'-d')\,\Theta(2r'-d')\,(\Delta\mathbf{v}'\cdot\hat{\mathbf{t}})\
, 
\hat{\mathbf{t}} \\
        \end{array}\right.\label{eqn_appendix_2}
\end{equation}


\noindent where $\mathcal{A}=A\tau/(m\,v_d)$ and 
$\mathcal{K}=\kappa B\tau/m$. \\ 

Notice that $\mathcal{A}$ and $\mathcal{K}$ are actually the only two 
control parameters in Eq.~(\ref{eqn_appendix_1}) for identical 
pedestrians. The ratio $\tau/m$ is common to both, but the magnitudes 
$Av_d^{-1}$ and $\kappa B$ handle each parameter separately.\\

The fact that $\mathcal{A}$ and $\mathcal{K}$ share the parameter $\tau$ is 
in agreement with the conclusions outlined in Ref.~\cite{johansson}. The 
relaxation time (or ``net-time headway'') $\tau$ actually ``weights'' the 
effects of the environment on the individual (that is, the social repulsion and 
the friction), and thus, appears as a ``key control parameter'' for the 
fundamental diagram as claimed in Ref.~\cite{johansson}.\\

The role of $\tau$ may be somewhat ambiguous whenever the social 
repulsion becomes negligible with respect to the friction. This may occur if 
some kind of balance exists between neighboring pedestrians in 
symmetrical configurations (\textit{i.e.} in crowded corridors). We may 
hypothesize that the ``key control parameter'' may correspond to either 
$\tau$, or, the friction itself $\kappa$. This is an open question, and a 
first order approach to this matter is outlined in Section~\ref{appendix_2}.\\


\section{\label{appendix_2}A simple model for the corridor}

A toy model for a moving crowd along a corridor is the one represented 
schematically in Fig.~\ref{pasillo}. Pedestrians (circles in 
Fig.~\ref{pasillo}) 
are assumed to be lined up from side to side across the corridor, at any given 
position. Social forces in the $x$-direction are further considered to vanish 
because of translational symmetry. Thus, only the sliding friction is allowed 
to balance the the pedestrians own desire. The (reduced) movement equation for 
the $x$-direction according to Section~\ref{appendix_1} and Fig.~\ref{pasillo} 
is  

\begin{figure}[htbp!]
\includegraphics[width=0.5\columnwidth]
{./plots/pasillo.eps}
\caption{\label{pasillo} Schematic diagram for individuals in a corridor. 
The circles represent pedestrians moving from left to right. The desired force 
(red arrows) and sliding friction (black arrows) are assumed to be the only 
relevant forces.}
\end{figure}

 
\begin{equation}
\displaystyle\frac{dv'}{dt'}(y')=1-v'(y')+f_g'(y'+\delta 
y')-f_g'(y'-\delta y')\label{eqn_appendix_2:1}
 \end{equation}

where $v'(y')$ corresponds to the (reduced) velocity (for the $x$-direction) of 
the individual located at the $y'$ position. Notice that the individuals 
remain at the same $y'$ position while traveling through the corridor, since 
balance is expected to take place across the corridor. These positions are 
roughly $\delta y'$, $3.\delta y'$, $5.\delta y'$,.... Actually, it is not 
relevant (for now) the value of $y'$, and a further simplification can be done 
by labeling $v'(y')=v_i$ and $v'(y'\pm 2.\delta y')=v_{i\pm 1}$. The velocity 
of the individual in contact with the bottom wall in Fig.~\ref{pasillo} will be 
labeled as $v_1$. \\

The last two terms in Eq.~(\ref{eqn_appendix_2:1}) correspond to the 
net drag applied on the pedestrian with velocity $v_i$. According to 
Eq.~(\ref{eqn_appendix_2}) this drag may be expressed as

\begin{equation}
 f_{g,i+\frac{1}{2}}'-f_{g,i-\frac{1}{2}}'=
  \left\{\begin{array}{lcl}
          2\alpha\,v_{2}-3\alpha\,v_{1} &  & i=1 \\
          & & \\
          2\alpha\,(v_{i+1}-2v_i+v_{i-1}) & & i>1\\
         \end{array}\right.\label{eqn_appendix_2:2}
\end{equation}

\noindent for $\alpha=\mathcal{K}(r'-\delta y')$. Recall that our first order 
approach considers $\delta y'$ as roughly uniform across the corridor. 

The stationary situation can be computed straight forward from 
Eq.~(\ref{eqn_appendix_2:1}). Thus, for $\dot{v}_{i}=0$ the following set of 
equations determine the velocity profile in the corridor (within this toy 
model)

\begin{equation}
  \left\{\begin{array}{lcl}
          (3\alpha+1)\,v_{1} - 2\alpha\,v_{2} & = & 1 \\
          & & \\
          -2\alpha\,v_{i-1}+(4\alpha+1)\,v_i-2\alpha\,v_{i+1} & = & 1\\
         \end{array}\right.\label{eqn_appendix_2:3}
\end{equation}

Notice from  Eq.~(\ref{eqn_appendix_2:2}) that $\alpha=0$ means no friction at 
all, and thus, the individuals are allowed to move free from drag. It can be 
verified that $v_i=1$ solves the set (\ref{eqn_appendix_2:3}) for this 
scenario. The $\alpha=0$ scenario is expected to occur, however, for densities 
below a contacting threshold. \\

A boundary condition needs to be imposed in order to solve 
Eqs.~(\ref{eqn_appendix_2:3}) for $\alpha\neq 0$. We fix 
$v_i=v_{i+1}$ at the middle of the corridor since the velocity profile 
should be symmetrically distributed with respect to the mid-axis of the 
corridor. Fig.~\ref{fig:appendix_2:1} shows the computed mean velocity for the 
bottom side profile as function of $\alpha$.\\


\begin{figure}[htbp!]
\includegraphics[width=0.5\columnwidth]
{./plots/fig_velocity_model.eps}
\caption{\label{fig:appendix_2:1} Mean velocity of the bottom half of the 
individuals vs. the parameter $\alpha$. Both axis are dimensionless. $N$ 
corresponds to the number of individuals. }
\end{figure}

Fig.~\ref{fig:appendix_2:1} exhibits a decreasing behavior for increasing 
values of $\alpha$. As explained above, the maximum value occurs at $\alpha=0$ 
(\textit{i.e.} $\langle v_i\rangle=1$). However, the decreasing slope slows 
down for increasing number of individuals. This corresponds to a flattening in 
the velocity profile, (see Section \ref{results} for details).  \\

The mean flux of individuals can be built from the mean velocity and the 
corresponding pedestrian density as follows

\begin{equation}
 J=\left\{\begin{array}{lcl}
          \rho & \mathrm{for} & \alpha=0 \\
          & & \\
          (\rho_0+c\,\alpha)\,\langle v_i\rangle & \mathrm{for}  & 
\alpha>0\\
         \end{array}\right.\label{eqn_appendix_2:4}
\end{equation}

where $\langle v_i\rangle$ equals unity for the case $\alpha=0$, and thus, it 
was omitted in (\ref{eqn_appendix_2:4}). The density $\rho=\rho_0+c\,\alpha$ 
corresponds to the packing density (that is, the density above the contacting 
threshold) and $c$ corresponds to a somewhat ``packing coefficient''. 
Fig.~\ref{fig:appendix_2:2} shows the flow as a function of the density, 
assuming $\rho_0=1$ for simplicity. \\


\begin{figure}[htbp!]
\includegraphics[width=0.5\columnwidth]
{./plots/fig_flux_model.eps}
\caption{\label{fig:appendix_2:2} Mean flux of the bottom half of the 
individuals vs. the pedestrian (global) density $\rho$ (see text for details). 
Both axis are dimensionless. The number of individuals across the 
corridor was set to $N=10$, and the contacting threshold was set to $\rho_0=1$. 
The ``packing coefficient'' was set to $c=1/\mathcal{K}$ (and thus, making the 
term $c\alpha$ independent of friction). The dashed line corresponds to the 
flux at the low density regime (say, $\langle v_i\rangle=1$).   }
\end{figure}


The pedestrian flux $J$ attains two possible behaviors, according to 
Fig.~\ref{fig:appendix_2:2}. For packing coefficients $c<0.05$, the flux 
diminishes as the corridor becomes more crowded. But, if $c$ surpasses this 
threshold, the flux slope becomes positive, although the mean velocity 
diminishes. We conclude that the role of the pedestrians' friction coefficient is crucial 
for building the fundamental diagram.   


\section{\label{appendix_3} Testing out previous results}


In this Appendix we show that the friction modification does not alter already studied behaviors of pedestrian dynamics (see Refs.~\cite{Dorso1,Dorso2,Dorso3}). In order to check this out, we performed numerical simulations of a room of 225 pedestrian escaping through a narrow door (bottleneck enclosure). The evacuation time (clearance time) $t_e$ is a function of the desired velocity $v_d$. This function has a minimum such that below it, $t_e$ is a decreasing function of $v_d$ while above, the tendency is reversed. It means that the evacuation process is optimum at moderated $v_d$ . This is a well known phenomenon called the Faster-is-Slower effect. This effect was reported in numerical simulations \cite{Dorso1,Dorso5} and it has also experimental support \cite{parisi1}. \\

In Fig.~\ref{fis} we show the evacuation time as a function of the desired velocity corresponding to a friction coefficient ten times grater than the friction coefficient of the original Social Force Model (\textit{i.e.} now $\kappa=2.4\times 10^{6}$). We can see that this modification preserves the Faster-is-Slower effect (and the Faster-is-faster effect). The inset exhibits the evacuation time as a function of the desired velocity with the friction coefficient of the original model ($\kappa=2.4\times 10^{5}$).\\

Another pedestrian dynamics phenomenon is the lane formation reported in bidirectional flows \cite{feliciani1,helbing5,guo1,qiao1}. This means, individuals spontaneously organize in lanes of uniform walking direction, if the pedestrian density is high enough. One of the major achievements of the Social Force Model is its ability to reproduced this emergent phenomenon in which the microscopic interactions between pedestrians is enough to produce a global pattern. We run a bidirectional flow simulation (not shown) and verified that the friction increment still reproduces the lane formation process.\\  

\begin{figure}[htbp!]
\includegraphics[width=0.5\columnwidth]
{./plots/fis_kx10.eps}
\caption{\label{fis} Mean evacuation time (seconds) vs. the pedestrian’s desired velocity (m/s). The room was 20 m $\times$ 20 m size. Mean values were computed from 30 evacuation processes. The pedestrians were initially placed in a regular square arrangement along the room with random velocities, resembling a Gaussian distribution with null mean value. The friction coefficient was $\kappa=2.4\times10^{6}$. The inset shows the evacuation time vs the desired velocity for the friction coefficient corresponding to the original model ($\kappa=2.4\times10^{5}$).  }
\end{figure}

Fig.~\ref{rate_fis} exhibits the ratio between the evacuation time with for the friction modified model and the evacuation time for the original model. This ratio is shown as a function of the desired velocity. As the desired velocity increases, the rate of evacuation times approaches a constant value $\sim$ 9. This result is in agreement with the formula Eq.(9) in Ref.\cite{sticco}. The friction force dominates in the range of high desired velocities since it promotes the collisions between pedestrians. within this regime, the Ec. (9) of  Ref. \cite{sticco} becomes a good approximation of the evacuation time. Thus, it is reasonable that dividing $t_e$ (for the enhanced friction) by $t_e$ (for the original model) yields a constant value for high $v_d$.  

\begin{figure}[htbp!]
\includegraphics[width=0.5\columnwidth]
{./plots/fis_cociente.eps}
\caption{\label{rate_fis} Rate of evacuation time ($t_e(\kappa_{10})/t_e$) vs the desired velocity. The room was 20 m $\times$ 20 m size. Mean values were computed from 30 evacuation processes. The pedestrians were initially placed in a regular square arrangement along the room with random velocities, resembling a Gaussian distribution with null mean value. The friction coefficient were $\kappa=2.4\times10^{6}$ and $\kappa=2.4\times10^{5}$. }
\end{figure}

We also tested the situation in which $k_i=2.4\times 10^{6}$ and $k_w=0$. We obtained similar results to the ones obtained when $k_i=k_w=2.4\times 10^{6}$ because in bottleneck evacuations the friction of the walls do not play a fundamental role in the evacuation process.
